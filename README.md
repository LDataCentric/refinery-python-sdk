# Kern AI API for Python

This is the official Python SDK for Kern AI, your IDE for programmatic data enrichment and management.

## Installation

You can set up this library via either running `$ pip install kern-sdk`, or via cloning this repository and running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` in your repository.

## Usage
Once you installed the package, you can access the application from any Python terminal as follows:

```python
from kern import Client

username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"
project_id = "your-project-id" # can be found in the URL of the web application

client = Client(username, password, project_id)
# if you run the application locally, please the following instead:
# client = Client(username, password, project_id, uri="http://localhost:4455")
```

Now, you can easily fetch the data from your project:
```python
df = client.fetch_export()
```

The `df` contains data of the following scheme:
- all your record attributes are stored as columns, e.g. `headline` or `running_id` if you uploaded records like `{"headline": "some text", "running_id": 1234}`
- per labeling task three columns:
  - `<attribute_name|None>__<labeling_task_name>__MANUAL`: those are the manually set labels of your records
  - `<attribute_name|None>__<labeling_task_name>__WEAK SUPERVISION`: those are the weakly supervised labels of your records
  - `<attribute_name|None>__<labeling_task_name>__WEAK SUPERVISION_confidence`: those are the probabilities or your weakly supervised labels

With the `client`, you easily integrate your data into any kind of system; may it be a custom implementation, an AutoML system or a plain data analytics framework üöÄ

## Roadmap
- [ ] Register information sources via wrappers
- [ ] Fetch project statistics
